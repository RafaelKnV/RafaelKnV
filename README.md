## Hi there! I'm Rafael Vitor  ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

I am a technology enthusiast and a full stack web developer since FOREVER. I love discovering new technologies and understanding how they work. This applies not only to the web, but to all types of technology: from hardware to software, whether it's in the gaming or automotive industry. I enjoy challenges that test my knowledge and push me to learn something new, even if it requires time and effort. For me, every obstacle is an opportunity for growth and improvement, as well as a way to stay updated in such a dynamic field like technology.

## About Me

I have been passionate about technology since forever, and I've always wanted to make a career out of it. However, despite my interest, I never had any contact with programming until March 2022, when I enrolled in the full-stack web developer course at TRYBE. Since then, I have been putting in a lot of effort and learning extensively to enter the tech industry.
